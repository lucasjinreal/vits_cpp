# VITS CPP

C++ based VITS inference, it was original token from `piper` but add support on Windows as well.
It can be run on macOS, windows, linux and even Raspberry Pi for your personal assistant voice synthesizer.

It was based on espeak-ng.

Currently still under going:

- [x] exe can be built out, need some dependencies data;
- [ ] English & Chinese support;
- [ ] Jpanese and Spanish suport;


As for now, for convenience, I drop some `dll` inside git, you can also built on your own if needed.

You should install onnxruntime (cpu is ok) into `c:\onnxruntime` if build on windows.
